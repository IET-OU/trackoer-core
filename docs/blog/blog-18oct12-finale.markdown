TRACK OER is a project supported by the JISC OER Rapid Innovation programme (OERRI). It has developed ways to help keep track of Open Educational Reources. OER have the challenge of being in the open and so actually what happens to content can become a bit of a mystery –- if content is trackable then we can improve what we know about use, help increase the evidence base and make it easier for those who want to reuse content to do the right thing.

In practice we have built three things. A transferable tracking system combining the Cut and Paste “CaPReT” software built by MIT in a previous JISC project, A way to add tracking code to downloads so that we can see where new copies are being used and served, and tools to help apply tracking. These have all been through the acceptance testing process of The Open University so that they can be rolled out into our systems and of course, the code is all open source and available.

We see this code as helping us know things that we just couldn't find out before and the content for the Bridge to Success courses has now been marked with the tracking code. We also know that it has triggered ideas that we want to take forward: better ways to embed content with good attribution and tracking, a trackable license chooser for creative commons, and better ways to share evidence in our OER Research hub.
