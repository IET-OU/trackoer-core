# Track OER/ \OER Commons bookmarklet service #

[TOER][toer] is a JISC-funded project to demonstrate technical solutions to the problem of tracking OERs. As part of the Track OER project we have developed a service to add license-tracker snippets to resources available through the [\OER Commons][oerc] portal.

Here's how it works:

 1. First visit the link, http://track.olnet.org/?edge=1
 2. Drag the bookmarklet at the bottom-right of the screen to your browser's bookmarks or favourites bar,
 3. Now visit http://oercommons.org, and browse to an \OER,
 4. Click on the Track OER bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar,
 5. Give it a few moments..
 6. And, you will see a license-tracker embed snippet that the Track OER service has produced.

By default the snippet uses [Piwik][piwik] no-Javascript tracking and a [Creative Commons Attribution License][cc-by]. You can switch to Google Analytics Javascript tracking, ... and a different license. As you can see this form is related to the [Creative Commons License chooser form][ccfm].

Currently the Track OER bookmarklet service is mostly a demonstration. It can be used by a publisher on small batches of OERs. Download the [Track OER code][code] and consider integrating it into your publishing workflow for full scale integration of tracking. We are considering extending the current functionality into an *Embed Me* or *Embed 'n' Track* service for OpenLearn and \OER Commons.
